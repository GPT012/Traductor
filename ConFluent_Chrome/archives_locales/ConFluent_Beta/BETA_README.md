# ConFluent (Beta) - Installation Guide

Hello Beta Tester! 👋

Thank you for helping test **ConFluent**, the seamless conversation translator.

## How to Install (Chrome / Brave / Edge)

Since this is a private beta version, you'll need to install it manually using "Developer Mode". It's safe and easy:

1.  **Unzip the file**: Extract the `ConFluent_v2.0.0.zip` file to a folder on your computer.
2.  **Open Extensions Page**:
    *   In Chrome, go to `chrome://extensions`
    *   Or click the puzzle piece icon 🧩 > "Manage Extensions".
3.  **Enable Developer Mode**: Toggle the switch in the top-right corner.
4.  **Load Unpacked**:
    *   Click the "Load unpacked" button (top-left).
    *   Select the folder you just unzipped (the one containing `manifest.json`).
5.  **Done!** You should see the ConFluent logo appear in your toolbar.

## How to Test

1.  Go to a chat app (Discord, WhatsApp Web, Slack) or any website.
2.  Start typing! You'll see the ConFluent orb appear.
3.  Click the orb or use the settings to configure your target language.
